This is a 12-bit grayscale image where spectral information is encoded into local spatial interference patterns.\n\nVisual Appearance: To the human eye, a Diffractogram looks like a slightly blurry or textured grayscale image.\n\n\n\nExample: A raw diffractogram of a butterfly. While it looks like a standard grayscale image, it contains hidden spectral information encoded in the local texture.\n\n\nInformation Content: The “blur” is actually a deterministic structure. A point source of green light creates a specific point-spread function (PSF) pattern. A point source of red light creates a different, wider pattern. By analyzing these local patterns, algorithms can mathematically disentangle the colors.\n\n\nAdvantages of the Diffractogram\n\nData Efficiency: The Diffractogram is a single 2D array. It is significantly smaller (10x-100x) than the 3D data cube it represents.\nSnapshot Acquisition: Because the encoding happens optically and instantaneously, the system captures the full spatial-spectral volume in a single integration period.\n\n\n    \n        Data Explosion Calculator\n        See how quickly hyperspectral data scales compared to Lumos.\n    \n    \n    \n        \n            Resolution (Side Length)\n            \n                \n                    128 x 128 px\n                    256 x 256 px\n                    512 x 512 px\n                    1024 x 1024 px\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            Video Duration\n            \n                \n                    30 Seconds\n                    1 Minute\n                    5 Minutes\n                    30 Minutes\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n\n\n\nFormat\nBands\nBit Depth\nRelative Size\nSingle Frame\nVideo Stream\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Demonstration: Encoding in Motion\nThe following video illustrates the encoding process for a dynamic scene (a butterfly).\n\nNote on Frame Sizes & Data Volume:\n\nHyperspectral (Top Right): The full 3D spectral cube is massive. In the video, you see the “unfolded” bands. Storing or transmitting this raw stream requires gigabits per second.\nRGB (Top Left): The standard color image we are used to. Low bandwidth, but low spectral information.\nDiffractogram (Bottom): This is the actual raw data captured by the Lumos sensor.\n\nResolution: It is a single monochrome frame, identical in pixel count to a standard b/w camera.\nInformation Density: Despite being just one frame (like the RGB or smaller), it encodes the entire spectral complexity of the scene shown in the Hyperspectral view.\nCompression: This illustrates the massive optical compression: we capture the complexity of the top-right video using the data budget of the bottom video."

    "text": "5. Manufacturing & Scalability\nA key differentiator of the Lumos approach is the fabrication method. Traditional spectral cameras require the assembly of discrete optical components (prisms, gratings, lenses) with tight mechanical tolerances. This manual assembly limits scalability.\nLumos utilizes Nano-Imprint Lithography (NIL) to fabricate the Diffractive Filter Arrays (DFA).\n\nWafer-Level Optics: The DFAs are manufactured on standard 8-inch or 12-inch wafers. Thousands of optics are created in a single process step.\nRobustness: The diffractive features are surface-relief structures on the order of micrometers. This scale makes them robust to minor fabrication errors, unlike metasurfaces which require nanometer-precision and are extremely sensitive to fabrication variance.\nCost Structure: This process allows the optics to be produced at volumes and costs comparable to standard consumer electronics components, enabling a path to ubiquity.\n\n\n\n\nMicroscope view of a fabricated DFA. The scale bar indicates the micro-scale features that diffract light."

This is a significant leap over previous snapshot spectral cameras which were often limited to very low resolutions (e.g., 64x64 or 512x512).\nSpectral Bands: The system is configurable, typically demonstrating 25+ bands in the Vis-NIR range (440–800 nm).\nField of View (FOV): Validated with standard C-mount lenses. The system maintains spectral accuracy across the FOV, overcoming the angle-sensitivity issues (blue shift) common in Fabry-Pérot or Interference-based filters.\nAccuracy: Spectral reproduction error is consistently &lt;15%, which is sufficient for the vast majority of classification and discrimination tasks."

    "text": "1. Industrial Quality Control: Detecting Invisible Contaminants\nThe Challenge: In manufacturing, contaminants often look identical to the product in the visible spectrum. Traditional RGB cameras cannot distinguish them, and traditional hyperspectral cameras are too slow and data-heavy for high-speed sorting.\nThe Experiment: We imaged a stream of mixed plastic pellets. Half were pure, and half were “tainted” with a clear varnish invisible to the naked eye.\n\nRGB Camera: Failed. The pure and tainted pellets appear identical.\nHyperspectral Camera: Succeeded, but required 15.87 MB of data per frame.\nLumos Camera: Succeeded with just 0.37 MB per frame (a 43:1 compression ratio).\n\nThe Result: Despite the massive data compression, the Lumos diffractogram retained the distinct spectral signature of the varnish. We achieved accurate, real-time classification of the “fake” pellets matching the ground truth.\nWhy it Matters: This proves that high-speed optical sorting and anomaly detection can be achieved with low-bandwidth hardware, reducing infrastructure costs for factories."

While visually similar (both are pink/red tissues), they have different chemical compositions and light absorption properties.\n\nMethod: We captured a single snapshot diffractogram and reconstructed the spectral data.\nAnalysis: Using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), we mapped the spectral signatures of the pixels.\nOutcome: The system successfully segmented the image, clearly differentiating the trachea (red overlay) from the lungs (green overlay) based solely on their spectral fingerprints.\n\nWhy it Matters: This validates the potential for computational staining—giving surgeons “superhuman” vision to differentiate healthy tissue from tumors or critical structures without dyes or delays.\n\n\n\n\n\nTissue Classification Results.
