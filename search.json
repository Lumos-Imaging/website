    "text": "Pathway A: Direct Inference (accessing spectral information without spectral cubes)\n“Why reconstruct a 50GB data cube just to answer a ‘Yes/No’ question?”\nFor all applications, the goal is not to see the spectrum; the goal is to act on it. A sorting robot needs to know “Is this plastic PVC?” A satellite needs to know “Is this crop stressed?” A microscope needs to know “Is this cell cancerous?”\nLumos enables Direct Inference. We can use modern data-driven machine-learning frameworks and pipelines to use diffractograms directly, mapping the unique texture of the optical code to the desired answer, completely skipping the heavy reconstruction step. Unlike hyperspectral cubes which quickly become too big even for modern GPUs, diffractograms are even smaller than RGB images, making them ideal for edge devices, drones, satellites or on-demand cloud processing.\n\n\n\nDirect Inference Pipeline. Deep Learning models ingest the raw diffractogram and directly output the desired variable (Class, Abundance, etc.), skipping the reconstruction step.\n\n\n\nGamechanging advantages of Direct Inference\n\nLatency:: The small signal allows inference to take place on the edge.\nBandwidth: Ideal for drones and satellites. Transmit the answer (bytes) or the compressed diffractogram (kilobytes) instead of the raw cube (gigabytes).\nEfficiency: Eliminates redundant computation. You don’t waste energy calculating spectral bands you don’t need. Storage is efficient and on-demand processing on the cloud becomes a possibility."

Ironically, analysts sometimes discard a lot of these data which is unnecessary for some applications since they’re only interested in a few wavelengths, or end up combining them to an end product that is much smaller than the original datasets. Spectral data cubes are not only huge, but information is encoded very redundantly in them, making it inefficient!\nDrone Telemetry: A UAV many not be able transmit live spectral video to a ground station because the bitrate can easily exceed standard wireless protocols.\nEdge Compute: Embedded processors cannot reconstruct and analyze heavy 3D data cubes in real-time (60 FPS).\nArchival: Storing petabytes of raw hyperspectral cubes for historical analysis is very expensive.\n\n\nLumos Solution: Analog Optical Compression.

    "text": "To break the barriers of cost and complexity, we didn’t just shrink a traditional spectrometer. We reimagined the physics of imaging.\nLumos employs a Computational Imaging approach. We shift the burden of complexity from bulky hardware (prisms, mirrors, moving parts) to sophisticated software. This allows us to use simple, robust, and scalable components to achieve performance that was previously impossible at this price point."

    "text": "System Architecture: A Drop-In Revolution\nThe Lumos camera looks, acts, and connects just like a standard machine vision camera. There are no slit-scanners, no heavy gimbals, and no fragile alignment mechanisms.\nThe physical stack consists of three layers:\n\nStandard Optics: Compatible with off-the-shelf C-Mount lenses.\nThe Diffractive Filter Array (DFA): Our core IP. A transparent, nanofabricated optical element bonded directly to the sensor.\nCommodity Sensors: We leverage the massive R&D economies of the mobile phone and industrial sensor markets.\n\nVis-NIR: Standard high-resolution CMOS sensors (e.g., Sony IMX).\nSWIR: InGaAs sensors for industrial sorting.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Optical Architecture. Light from the scene passes through the transparent DFA placed ~50µm from the sensor pixels. The DFA creates a micro-scale diffraction pattern that encodes spectral data into the image."

Thousands of DFAs are produced in a single step. * Cost: This semiconductor-based approach drives the unit cost down by orders of magnitude compared to traditional interference filters or prisms. * Robustness: The DFA is a solid-state surface relief structure. It is immune to vibration and thermal drift.\n\n\n\nMicroscopic view of the DFA. These micro-scale ridges diffract light based on wavelength, encoding the spectrum into the spatial domain."

    "section": "Breaking the Resolution Limit (True HD)",
    "text": "Breaking the Resolution Limit (True HD)\nOne of the greatest compromises in snapshot spectral imaging has always been resolution. Traditional “Mosaic” cameras (using pixel-level filters) trade spatial resolution for spectral bands, often resulting in grainy, low-fidelity images (e.g., \\(400 \\times 400\\) pixels).\nLumos delivers True High Definition.\nBecause our diffractive encoding is continuous and distributed, we preserve high-frequency spatial details that other systems lose. As validated in our recent Optica publication, we achieve:\n\n~1 Megapixel Resolution: \\(1304 \\times 744\\) spatial pixels.\nFull Spectral Context: 25+ bands across the Vis-NIR range.\n\nThis allows Lumos sensors to be used in applications requiring fine detail, such as detecting small defects on a production line or identifying features from high-altitude drones."
