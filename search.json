    "text": "Most of the physical world is invisible to our eyes and to standard RGB cameras.\nConventional imaging systems—whether in your phone or an industrial robot—are designed to mimic Human Vision. They capture light in three broad channels: Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). While this is perfect for photography, it is a sub-optimal approach for sensing.\nBy averaging light into these three broad buckets, RGB cameras throw away 99% of the physical information contained in the spectrum. This creates a dangerous ambiguity: a red plastic apple and a real red apple may look very similar to an RGB sensor, yet they are chemically distinct."

    "text": "3. The Dimensionality Curse (Data)\n One understated barrier to widespread spectral adoption is the massive size of hyperpectral volumes. An uncompressed image array must be stored and processed for every spectral band.\nConsequences:\n\nSatellite Downlinks: An earth-observation satellite creates terabytes of data. Downlinking this via limited radio bandwidth is prohibitively expensive or slow. Operators often discard 90% of the data. Ironically, analysts sometimes discard a lot of these data which is unnecessary for some applications since they’re only interested in a few wavelengths, or end up combining them to an end product that is much smaller than the original datasets. Spectral data cubes are not only huge, but information is encoded very redundantly in them, making it inefficient!\nDrone Telemetry: A UAV many not be able transmit live spectral video to a ground station because the bitrate can easily exceed standard wireless protocols.\nEdge Compute: Embedded processors cannot reconstruct and analyze heavy 3D data cubes in real-time (60 FPS).\nArchival: Storing petabytes of raw hyperspectral cubes for historical analysis is very expensive.\n\nThe “Data Tax” of Traditional Imaging In traditional systems, spectral resolution is tied to data volume. If you want 100x more spectral detail, you must transmit 100x more data. This makes real-time applications impossible.\nThe Lumos Decoupling Lumos breaks this linear relationship. Because we capture the continuous light field encoded in a single frame, our file size is constant. Whether you need 5 bands or 25 bands, the transmission cost is identical—roughly the size of a standard black-and-white photo.\nFor a standard \\(512 \\times 512\\) pixel sensor, the uncompressed data requirements vary drastically:\n\n    \n        \n            Data Explosion Calculator\n            \n            \n                \n                    Image Resolution\n                    \n                        128 x 128 px\n                        256 x 256 px\n                        512 x 512 px\n                        1024 x 1024 px\n                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    Video Duration\n                    \n                        30 Seconds\n                        1 Minute\n                        5 Minutes\n                        30 Minutes\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n\n\n\nFormat\nChannels in image\nSpectral Bands\nBits per pixel\nRelative Size\nSingle Frame\nVideo Stream\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n        \n            * Software-Defined: Traditional cameras pay a \"data tax\" for spectral resolution—adding bands increases file size linearly. Lumos decouples storage from spectral resolution. We capture the continuous spectrum encoded in a single frame, meaning your raw transmission cost is constant regardless of how many bands you extract later. While you can mathematically define any basis (e.g., simulating 5 specific agricultural filters or a standard RGB curve), our hardware is validated to resolve ≈26 independent equally-spaced spectral channels in the 400–800 nm range.\n        \n  \n    \n\n\n\n\nLumos Solution: Analog Optical Compression. Spectral “cubes” are known to be highly redundant and users of these data often throw away most of it. The Lumos Camera captures instead a lean signal that encodes spatial and spectral content in a very information-dense manner. Not to be confused with software compression, this represents a massive reduction in raw data volume, enabling the use in modern machine learning pipelines, efficient transmission from space, cloud archival and retrieval, and real-time processing for edge AI applications. Even HD video streams are possible, whereas traditional approaches are still unfeasible.\n\nLearn more about the Lumos Solution"

    "section": "Pathway A: Direct Inference",
    "text": "Pathway A: Direct Inference\nThe Efficiency Paradigm: Answers, not cubes. In these examples, we bypass the heavy generation of 3D data cubes. Algorithms extract the answer directly from the raw, compressed Diffractogram. This enables real-time performance on edge devices or efficient transmission to the cloud.\n\nIndustrial SortingAgricultural MonitoringRemote Sensing\n\n\nIndustry: Manufacturing, Recycling, and Quality Control.\nThe Problem: In high-speed sorting lines, contaminants often look identical to the product. Standard RGB cameras cannot distinguish between a clear PET plastic pellet and a clear PVC pellet, or detect a clear varnish coating on a colored object. Hyperspectral cameras can detect this, but the data volume (gigabytes per minute) is often too heavy for real-time processing.\nThe Lumos Result: In this simulation using real Lumos camera measurements, we sorted multi-colored pellets. Half were “pure,” and half were coated with an invisible varnish.\n\nMethod: We bypassed spectral reconstruction entirely, training a classifier to run directly on the video feed.\nEfficiency: The system performed accurate classification using a stream of 0.37 MB frames, whereas a comparable 25-band spectral camera would require 15.87 MB per frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDeep Dive: The Data Advantage\n\n\n\n\n\nBy processing the diffractogram directly, we achieve a 43x reduction in data bandwidth. This allows for higher frame rates on the sorting line and reduces the computational load on the sorting robot’s embedded processor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal-time Inference: The video shows the system correctly identifying Tainted (red) vs. Pure (green) pellets despite them looking identical in RGB.Note the massive file size difference of Lumos Diffractogram vs 25-band hyperspectral cube (15.87 MB vs 0.37 MB per frame).\n\n\n\n\nIndustry: Supply Chain, Food Storage, and Phenotyping.\nThe Problem: Monitoring the ripening or spoilage of produce requires continuous observation. A standard camera can only see external color changes, which often happen too late. A hyperspectral camera could track internal chemistry (sugar/water content), but recording a continuous spectral video over days would generate unmanageable amounts of data (TB of storage).\nThe Lumos Result: We monitored an avocado rotating on a turntable every 10 minutes for 10 days.\n\nCapabilities: From the raw diffractogram data, we successfully 1) segmented the avocado from the background and 2) generated a localized estimate of the ripening index over time.\nData Volume: The full 1,000-frame video at high resolution (800x600) occupied just ~922 MB. A comparable 100-band hyperspectral video would have exploded to ~50.4 GB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDeep Dive: Snapshot Advantage\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause Lumos uses a snapshot architecture, each frame is captured instantly. This allows us to image the rotating avocado without the “shearing” or motion artifacts that would ruin the image on a traditional line-scanning (push-broom) spectral camera.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-Duration Monitoring: The graph tracks the estimated ripening index. The snapshot capability ensures distortion-free imaging of the rotating 3D object.\n\n\n\n\nIndustry: Satellite Earth Observation and Environmental Monitoring.\nThe Problem: Satellites generate Terabytes of data, but radio downlinks are a thin pipe. Operators often have to discard vast amounts of hyperspectral data because they cannot transmit it to Earth.\nThe Lumos Result: We simulated a Lumos sensor in orbit using public Landsat 8 data. We trained a neural network to detect a specific vegetation signature.\n\nMethod: The model estimated the per-pixel abundance (0-100%) of the vegetation directly from the diffractogram.\nEfficiency: Instead of downlinking a massive data cube, the satellite could downlink the lightweight diffractogram (for ground processing) or process it on-orbit and downlink just the abundance map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDeep Dive: Efficient Transmission\n\n\n\n\n\nThis experiment validates that the encoded “texture” of the diffractogram contains sufficient information to perform sub-pixel abundance estimation. This effectively solves the downlink bottleneck, allowing small-sats to deliver hyperspectral-grade intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput: Raw Diffractogram (Lightweight)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrediction: Estimated Abundance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGround Truth: Full Spectrum\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of the predicted vegetation abundance (Center) vs. the Ground Truth (Right), derived solely from the compressed input (Left)."

Surgeons currently rely on invasive biopsies or chemical dyes to differentiate them.\nThe Lumos Result: We imaged ex-vivo chicken tissue containing both lung and trachea.\n\nMethod: We reconstructed the spectral cube and applied a simple Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).\nOutcome: Despite the visual similarity, the system cleanly separated the tissues based on their spectral signatures. This proof-of-concept confirms that Lumos technology can provide the spectral discrimination necessary for biological applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDeep Dive: Learn More\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a detailed breakdown of the reconstruction accuracy and the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classification, please refer to our published paper in Optica.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTissue Classification: (A) Reconstructed image with classification overlay. (B) Spectral curves showing distinct signatures for Lung vs. Trachea which enabled the clean segmentation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustry: Supply Chain and Predictive Quality.\nThe Problem: Spoilage often begins chemically before it becomes visible. Supply chain managers need to know not just if a fruit is bad, but when it will go bad.\nThe Lumos Result: We monitored strawberries continuously over 8 days.\n\nMethod: By reconstructing the spectral cubes, we tracked the degradation of the “Green Peak” (chlorophyll) and shifts in the “Red Edge.”\nOutcome: A regression analysis performed on the reconstructed spectra could predict the exact age of the fruit and classify “Fresh” vs. “Spoiled” with high accuracy before visible mold appeared. This proves the reconstructed spectra has sufficient fidelity for predictive regression models.\n\n\n\n\n\nPredictive Aging: (Left) The spectral evolution of the fruit over 8 days. (Right) ROC curve demonstrating high accuracy in classifying freshness states.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustry: Scientific Imaging and Space Domain Awareness.\nThe Problem: Traditional telescopes use mechanical filter wheels to capture different colors (e.g., Johnson-Cousins B, V, R, I filters). This is slow (sequential) and inefficient (absorptive filters block light).\nThe Lumos Result: We simulated a stellar field and captured the data in a single snapshot.\n\nSoftware-Defined Bands: Instead of using physical filters, we reconstructed the spectral response curves mathematically. We didn’t need to reconstruct 100 arbitrary bands; we solved directly for the B, V, R, and I transmission curves.\nOutcome: We recovered accurate photometric ratios from a single exposure, proving that one Lumos sensor can replicate the function of a multi-filter mechanical assembly without the moving parts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDeep Dive: Basis Selection\n\n\n\n\n\nThis experiment highlights the power of A Posteriori Basis Selection. We captured the light first, then decided after the fact that we wanted to view the data through Johnson-Cousins filters. This flexibility is impossible with traditional hardware filters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynthetic Stellar Imaging: (Top) Raw Diffractograms of three stars. (Bottom) Accurate recovery of B, V, R, and I photometric coefficients from a single exposure, matching the ground truth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady to deploy this technology?\nWe are moving from R&D to commercial scale and seeking strategic partners.\nPartner with Lumos →"
